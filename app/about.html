    <h5>&ndash;What is <strong>Wargame Odds?</strong></h5>
    <p> It is a project, created in spare time to practice web-development skills by me, Alexey Usachev, long-time wargamer.</p>
    <p>It is a tool to analyse statistics in tabletop wargames to help you make right decisions. Can I hope to one-round this enemy with all my attacks? Can I probably win this particular combat? Where to distribute attacks: at a dangerous, but tough, hero or at pathetic, but numerous mooks? These questions are of a kind that this site hopes to answer.</p>
    <p>At the moment only 9th Age wargame is supported, and with limited functionality, but that is going to be improved in the future.</p>
    <h5>How can I support the site, if i would like to?</h5>
    <p>First of all, thanks for your kindness in that case. You can use <a href="donation.html">donation page</a> for that.</p>
    <h5>&ndash;What other games will be supported?</h5>
    <p>There are a lot of games, that I play time-to-time, including
    <ul>
        <li>Warmachine</li>
        <li>Infinity</li>
        <li>Maurice</li>
        <li>Field of Glory</li>
        <li>Malifaux</li>
        <li>Saga</li>
        <li>and some others...</li>
    </ul>
    Some of them are going to be implemented in the future, in no particular order and without any deadlines. Warhammer40k and AOS are also possible. 9th Age was done first only because it is the most straightforward to make and I am interested in it at the moment.</p>
    <h5>&ndash;Hey, the 9th age calculator is not complete at all! I play SA and there is no option for Born Predator! When will it be ready?</h5>
    <p>Sure, there are a lot of things missing at the moment: born predator, random attacks, wound multiplication, combined profiles and so on. It all takes time to implement and I do not have a lot of it at the moment. I hope I will be able to do it all in near (or not so near) future.</p>
    <p> The other feature I am looking forward to making is unit versus unit combat analysis with possible outcomes with probability assigned, like "Unit 1 loses X models, kills Y models and breaks on round 1 of combat: Z%". That's a bit tricky to do, though.</p>
    <h5>&ndash;Are you somehow ivolved in development of any of these games?</h5>
    <p>No, and all copyright for their content  belongs not to me but where it belongs. The site, on the other hand, is mine.</p>
    <h5>&ndash;I have a suggestion and/or a question for you, how can I contact you?</h5>
    <p>Feel free to <a class="fa fa-envelope" href="mailto:usachev.dev@gmail.com"> send me a letter</a> anytime. I am looking forward for your feedback and suggestions.</p>
    <h5>&ndash;I found a bug, what can I do?</h5>
    <p>Please <a class="fa fa-envelope" href="mailto:usachev.dev@gmail.com?Subject=WargameOdds%20Bug"> mail</a> me with subject "WargameOdds Bug", I would appreciate it very much.</p>
    <h5>&ndash;I hate this site and you should stop doing it.</h5>
    <p>Sorry to disappoint you, luckily for you, there are alternatives on the Internet.</p>
    <h5>&ndash;I do not play 9th Age, but I am interested in another game. Can you please implement it?</h5>
    <p>Development takes a lot of time and effort and currenlty I am working on the site in my spare time, but if you want to help, you can send me money from the <a href="donation.html">donation page</a>, that will sure hasten the process.</p>
    <p id="happy">Happy wargaming!</p>
